### about Manifest V3

This add-on will eventually get MV3 after firefox obsolete MV2
and if I still need this add-on.

If you want it sooner, you can [buy me a coffee about MV3][bmc]
to encourage me to work on this.
The timeline is:

* 10 months if 20 USD
* 6 months if 40 USD
* 2 months if 60 USD

Please find the details in the link.

By the way, we can not add MV2 features to the chrome version now
since Chrome Web Store no longer allow uploading the MV2 add-on.
